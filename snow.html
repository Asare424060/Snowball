      <p>
     In 1854, London was in the midst of a cholera pandemic . At that time, knowledge about germs and other microorganisms as causes of disease was limited. At the time, many people believed that the disease spread through the air like a kind of poisonous vapor. Dr. John Snow collected data and mapped information to look for patterns, just as GIS researchers and analysts would do today. They explore the data collected by John Snow using pop-ups and heatmap symbology to illustrate whether cholera spread through the air or through other means.
